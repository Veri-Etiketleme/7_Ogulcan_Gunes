    "## What is Keyword Exctraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword extraction is defined as the task that automatically identifies a set of the terms that best describe the subject of document. This is an important method in information retrieval (IR) systems: keywords simplify and speed up the search. Keyword extraction can be used to reduce the dimensionality of text for further text analysis (text classification ot topic modeling). [S.Art et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.2699), for example, extracted keywords to measure patent similarity. Using keyword extraction, you can automatically index data, summarize a text, or generate tag clouds with the most representative keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to extract the keywords?\n",
    "\n",
    "All keyword extraction algorithms include the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Candidate generation*. Detection of possible candidate keywords from the text.\n",
    "- *Property calculation*. Computation of properties and statistics required for ranking.\n",
    "- *Ranking*. Computation of a score for each candidate keyword and sorting in descending order of all candidates. The top n candidates are finally selected as the n keywords representing the text.\n",

For instance, non-negative matrix factorization meets us 5 time: non negative matrix, negative matrix, nmf, matrix factorization, matrix. Adding a 4-grams does not change the situation. Similar keywords appears due to the fact that TF-IDF does not take into account the context, the keywords importance comes only from their frequencies relationship. Thus, TF-IDF is a quick, intuitive, but not the best way to extract keywords from the text. Let's look at other ways."
