pigs when young up to being kill for bacon
when they are young you have to mate 3 days then you can inject them for pneumonia diseases
you have mark shone they have dry straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a folk in with them because the mother might tock it down and the little pigs might stab them souve
we give them worm powder
that is when they get the worm
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can get out of the way of where mother
some people put a light in with them to keep them warm
you have to make shone that mother has a lot of milk
if she has not got a nougth milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they come eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts if fating
they can eat some meal when they get a little bigger
we give them some fating food called nomber 2
when you wean that is take them from their mother you have got to see if they fight if there is any little ones
fighting
when they ann big you have to see about waving
when they have been laid and teddy to go away to be kill

they had cleaned the river and made it very wide for the ducks
there were some potato in the water
there were some brussels men sitting in the parth way round a fire
we had to go on to a ploud field to get round them this made my shoes hevey
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did i but we still went
the dew on the brussels leaves made them book girls

the family of six life in a counsel house just outside Londen but something whenet wrong
mother and father were always shouting at each other the people across the street could hear them figthing the children would cry tommy was the oldest he was 12 he was more grown up that than the others
jane was 8 she was frightened of her mum and dad Jone was 5 and alan 1 1/2 years
he was too young to to understand he was crying all the time never the less
it happened to me when i was 4 years old i very nearly died
it was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and i were out for a walk i had my photo taken near a brook
i still have the photo
the brook was about 8 feet wide
the water was about 2 feet deep
but the was 6 feet of wet slimy mud i was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in i went
i slowly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister stopped and saved my life she held my head above water until my sisters got home and told my parents
then they raced down to the brook dad hate a hell of a job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually this got me out and carried me home
my clothes had to mr distrod it took seven bats to get me clean
Im am never alloud to sit up and watch programmes not surtebull for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out the was a film on tv unfit for children i sat and watched it it was all murder and killing men were being hung and mother were being shot or stabbed
men had their heads cut in half
my work on a farm i have live on a farm all of my life i am not boasting but i think i know a fair bit about farming
i know most about cattle and only a little about machinery
some people say farming is the lowest played and hardest working employment out
i agree with those people
but i would rather work for my living than just sitting in a stuffy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do
give me the open air life
my father is a farm stockman and i hope to take on the same job when i leave school
i am going to take my apprentiship course when i leave at easter
that means that i go to classes one a week
i will learn a lot more about farming and if i pull through the course i will be a usfull chap about the farm
Will i am taking my course i will be wet 17 shillings less than the boy worker that is not taking the course
but when i am 17 and finished my Apprentiship i will get 10 more than the average pay of a boy my age
many people asked me why i have chosen farming as my future career
1 i will be in the open air
2 i will be doing a different job every day 3 i am not interested in enthing else
for the last 2 or 3 years i am have been worm on the farm in the holidays
and i can tell the men i have worked with have been good and gives me a few tips
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which i know will help when i like school
so if anybody wants an open air life choose farming

an apple
it comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name gascoyne's scarlet
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
when you go scrumping you have got to be careful you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples
when i go scrumping all i go after is apples and plums pears
when you go pinching apples you do not want to take too many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you a specally little boys they make too much noise
if you pick apples off of the ground you have to be careful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump where ever it stings you
when you are by yourself and someone comes and you have to climb over the barn wire and get caught the man will probably catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you
some people when they catch you they might hit you and laid he will hit you harder next time he catches you
but some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again but the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat
it is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses
when i go scrumping i do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard
i never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be reconnised very easy because red shows up very easy
but still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
the fox the fox is a sly old beast he sits in his den cleaning and waiting to make another savage attack he walks the field to the farm the smell of chickens in the passing breeze
he's gone to collect his meal
he makes a leap
chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal
winter when the snow lay round about the robins come out to seek crumbs their feet are numb but the snow still lies round about
a tree is a place for song that's where birds sing their sweet song

Stranden on a desert island
one midsummer's day at 9.30 a.m
a ship was wrecked by a coral reef so people jumped overboard
people who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death the ship was sinking fast but some still hung on
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore
getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfits
so one man volunteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room
Their were dead boys on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreck
Their were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island
the man who swam from the island went down to the store room
he held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water
as he open the store room door the water gushed in very quickly
so he had to feel for the diving suits
he brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5
he got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent two men to help him
when they arrived they all put their diving suits on then went down to get some food
Luckily enough it was mostly tins food
they brought quite a lot up for the people on the island
when looking around the deck they saw a lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in
they all had one tin of something each
they all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough
after they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts
they all decided that there would only be two meals a day
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested
there was about 35 on the island but people who use't to get coconuts usually got lost or got bitten by a snake
they had shortened lone from 35 to 15
they kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to
and they could also catch fish to eat
after several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them in september food was running short so they till animals and drank fresh water from springs
they found here and there
they found coconuts while hunting for animals
they took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside
they caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the ground and sticks laid across with grass on top of them
at night they slept all together under coconut trees
they were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning
one morning in december a ship was going across the sea to england they waved and waved again
then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted
as soon as they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the captain's office
they all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in june and we have been there since
they arrived in england 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in england again

so we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out and it was very dark in there then stephen was sitting there next to me and pauline said go on stephen hold judith's hand and after a while he did and he didn't let go of it until the film was over
the best boyfriend i ever had
she's father was posted
and so stephen left
but we still send letters and postcards to each other
so that we still remember each other
one fine morning i got up and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee but at my disaster i found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep so i grabbed it quick and brought it in it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes well of course i would have loved to keep the child but i knew that wouldn't be right so i telephoned the police and told them everything that had happened and told me to take the baby down to the police station
so i got ready and set off to the station
of course i liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the police
they said that they would put up notices about the baby
they let me look after him until someone owned up
a month later
a month went but nobody owned up and the police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said i could adopt the baby if i wanted to if not they would put it in a home
i soon got married and talked it over with my husband and he said it was ok with him so in a few days time the baby was ours and were'nt we pleased
so we all lived happily ever after
the end
when i am a children's nurse
when i get the job of a children's nurse i shall be very happy i'm sure there will be lots of other nurses there to help look after the children we have to put the children to bed and get them dressed give them where food and toys to play

in the summer holidays
one day about the second week i was going shopping and taking my friend for a walk
when three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags for me of course i went as red as beetroot but when i came back they called me again so after a while i went and picked it up i started talking to them every day
betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner they got 2 lb of potatoes 1 large tin beans and 1/2lb ham and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6 10d when they got home the girls cooked the meal
they started out and the sea got deeper but it was lovely the sun was shining like a star glittering at night the sea was calm and bright as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea it was just like a dream which has come true
because it's night time and dark
because the wind is wild
because the two waves are a ring
it's where the sea has washed away the side of the rocks
the front of the boat where the sea ran up the beach
because there are trees in way there whispering to each other the sun is hot with wild animals roaming around
the beach is so hot and the sea is calm animals are roaming here and there

they ran away to get married in a little country called lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother father maids and four children the eldest was jenny who was 18 years of age she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12 jenny had a boyfriend who lived a few yards away from her his name was johnny he was 20 years of age
jenny and johnny wanted to get marreid they had known each other for 6 years and were very much in love
they had got mostly everything to start with they had a double bed curtains dressing table crockery and lots of other things to start a married home
but the only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent to the marriage
so the two young children decided to run away and get married
so they packed a few clothes and johnny got two tickets on a train to london they had some money in the bank about 30
so one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clock and made their way to the station
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast
soon they were on the train
now we needn't worry about anything my darling said johnny
no we can get a job in london and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own said jenny
yes then we can go back home tell our parents the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to london
2 months pass they got a flat and were now thinking of getting married so they got married in a registry office and after they celebrated until 12 o'clock that night then a week later they got tickets back to lawton they got home and went and rang on jenny's doorbell first
her father came to the door and took one look and slammed the door in their faces and shouted out i don't know where you've been but i don't want you to lay a step inside this house you're an absolute disgrace to our family but dad shouted jenny i've only come home to tell you the news what's that he said i am married that's why i and johnny ran away we got married in a registry office
so said her father oh well i wish you the best of luck in your marriage but i do wish you'd told us all because i think you are old enough to be man and wife well my daughter and son in law welcome home
you can live here both of you until you get a decent place of your own thank you dad and thank you sir said johnny don't call me sir my son you're one of us now so you may as well call me dad i must go and fetch your parents johnny and we will celebrate said her father all the family got together and celebrated
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl and they all lived happily ever after

just a few lines to write about our english lesson with mr holbrook in the last 12 months
he has taught us how to write good letters stories and poems
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years
but some work hasn't taught us a single thing we have to learn a fair bit of english to help us as we get older and out to work
love and best wishes judith

sir
mr t says mr holbrook is too soft with us by not teaching us spellings
i agree with mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell i am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words differcult but people who get under 40 find words very differcult
if you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school
i think mr holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so i think it is essential that we should write properly
i have written a lot of stories in the term i have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so i find it quite easy
william glebe
sir
mr t says that mr holbrook our english teacher is too soft and does'nt teach us very good english but i don't believe one word of it it is absolutely nonsense he is a good enough teacher for any child to learn from
we write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them
mr t said it will be be harder for us when we leave school but if we consantrate and listen to what we are told in english we will have no trouble when we go out into the world
when we write stories i think the story is much more important than the spellings and punctuation
yours faithfully judith
when we have mr holbrook we have to write a story and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea our sinking of
jack o'malley
we have to work hard and it tacks hard work to write those storm and it very hard when people say he soft on us
joan stall
i think mr t should come and see mr
holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a frame magazine

pigs when young up to being kill for bacon
when they are young you have to mate 3 days then you can inject them for pneumonia diseases
you have mark shone they have dry straw
when you clean them out you should not leave a folk in with them because the mother might tock it down and the little pigs might stab them souve
we give them worm powder
that is when they get the worm
this will stop them from going thin
you should box a little place off so only the little pigs can get in it
that is so they can get out of the way of where mother
some people put a light in with them to keep them warm
you have to make shone that mother has a lot of milk
if she has not got a nougth milk you will have to feed them on a bottle
when they come eat a little bit you can get them some little nuts if fating
they can eat some meal when they get a little bigger

the family of six life in a counsel house just outside Londen but something whenet wrong
mother and father were always shouting at each other the people across the street could hear them figthing the children would cry tommy was the oldest he was 12 he was more grown up that than the others
jane was 8 she was frightened of her mum and dad Jone was 5 and alan 1 1/2 years
he was too young to to understand he was crying all the time never the less
it happened to me when i was 4 years old i very nearly died
it was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and i were out for a walk i had my photo taken near a brook
i still have the photo
the brook was about 8 feet wide
the water was about 2 feet deep
but the was 6 feet of wet slimy mud i was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in i went
i slowly sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister stopped and saved my life she held my head above water until my sisters got home and told my parents
then they raced down to the brook dad hate a hell of a job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually this got me out and carried me home
my clothes had to mr distrod it took seven bats to get me clean
Im am never alloud to sit up and watch programmes not surtebull for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out the was a film on tv unfit for children i sat and watched it it was all murder and killing men were being hung and mother were being shot or stabbed
men had their heads cut in half
my work on a farm i have live on a farm all of my life i am not boasting but i think i know a fair bit about farming
i know most about cattle and only a little about machinery
some people say farming is the lowest played and hardest working employment out
i agree with those people
but i would rather work for my living than just sitting in a stuffy old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do
give me the open air life
my father is a farm stockman and i hope to take on the same job when i leave school
i am going to take my apprentiship course when i leave at easter
that means that i go to classes one a week
i will learn a lot more about farming and if i pull through the course i will be a usfull chap about the farm
Will i am taking my course i will be wet 17 shillings less than the boy worker that is not taking the course
but when i am 17 and finished my Apprentiship i will get 10 more than the average pay of a boy my age
many people asked me why i have chosen farming as my future career
1 i will be in the open air
2 i will be doing a different job every day 3 i am not interested in enthing else
for the last 2 or 3 years i am have been worm on the farm in the holidays
and i can tell the men i have worked with have been good and gives me a few tips
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which i know will help when i like school
so if anybody wants an open air life choose farming

as i looked at this picture it made me think the people were drunk
the people throw the things on the floor
the woman put the baby in the chair in the corner so that they can have a sleep
they opened the window to let the fresh air in
this picture wet painted in the olden days
it was dark in the house but not outside
it looks to me as if it was raining
the dog is licking up the scraps
the bird is up in his cage wondering what is happing
look at the old fashion shoes
They socks come up to the top of the legs like long grandpa's pants
one of the children are playing with the fire
when a woman looks in her pram
one day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping
she went into the shop to order her weekly meat of course she left her baby outside the shop
her baby was still sitting her its pram but the little baby was crying
the little baby could not talk much he could say little words
He's mum said to him now what are you crying for my little baby he keep on man man he meant that man which were going down the road at first she could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram and a woman came over the road 2 said you better watch where you leave your baby misses the baby's mother said why so the other lady said because you know that old man which s just gone down the road well he tried to take your little baby out of its pram
so she said thank you very much for telling me and said goodbye so the lady wall on with her baby
this time she went into the baker's to get some bread
the old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger which was just aside the baker's
the lady went in and while she was in the man changed baby's
so he had the white one and she had the black one of course he ran away no one saw him
she came out of the baker's and looked in her pram a saw the baby asleep
she went home 2 while the baby was asleep she done some jobs
when she had done her jobs she said to herself the baby is having a long sleep
i go and see if he is still asleep
she opened the gown and she son a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted
after she had shouted she put on her coat and went and phoned the police
the police said they would be here in a very few minutes
as soon as she had a knock on the door she said come in it was the policemen
the police said what can we do for you miss
so she said this is not my baby i had a white one so the police said when did you first find out she said just a minute ago
just before before i phoned you
one of the police said did you leave it outside a shop and she said yes while i went in the baker's
she was crying the other policeman said
tell us the whole story so she told them to sit down and asked them if they wanted a cup of tea they said yes
so she put on the kettle and then sat down and told them the story about her baby
and the police said they would try and find her own baby
the very long days went by and still they couldn't find the baby but afterawhile the police heard a little about the baby
the woman was very upset
and one day the two polce men came to her house holding a white baby
so the woman gran the baby and said thank you very much for finding him
i will give you 5 pounds reward
the policemen took the 5 ponud and shared it
and the old woman lived happy ever after and all ways took her own baby were ever she went

an apple
it comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name gascoyne's scarlet
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
when you go scrumping you have got to be careful you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples
when i go scrumping all i go after is apples and plums pears
when you go pinching apples you do not want to take too many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you a specally little boys they make too much noise
if you pick apples off of the ground you have to be careful of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump where ever it stings you
when you are by yourself and someone comes and you have to climb over the barn wire and get caught the man will probably catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you
some people when they catch you they might hit you and laid he will hit you harder next time he catches you
but some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again but the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat
it is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses
when i go scrumping i do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard
i never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be reconnised very easy because red shows up very easy
but still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples
the fox the fox is a sly old beast he sits in his den cleaning and waiting to make another savage attack he walks the field to the farm the smell of chickens in the passing breeze
he's gone to collect his meal
he makes a leap
chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal
winter when the snow lay round about the robins come out to seek crumbs their feet are numb but the snow still lies round about
a tree is a place for song that's where birds sing their sweet song
the leaves have gone
it will not be long before the tree has gone
Stranden on a desert island
one midsummer's day at 9.30 a.m
a ship was wrecked by a coral reef so people jumped overboard
people who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death the ship was sinking fast but some still hung on
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore
getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving outfits
so one man volunteered to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room
Their were dead boys on the deck within 20 minutes of the shipwreck
Their were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island
the man who swam from the island went down to the store room
he held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water
as he open the store room door the water gushed in very quickly
so he had to feel for the diving suits
he brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5
he got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent two men to help him
when they arrived they all put their diving suits on then went down to get some food
Luckily enough it was mostly tins food
they brought quite a lot up for the people on the island
when looking around the deck they saw a lifeboat but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in
they all had one tin of something each
they all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough
after they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts
they all decided that there would only be two meals a day
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested
there was about 35 on the island but people who use't to get coconuts usually got lost or got bitten by a snake
they had shortened lone from 35 to 15
they kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to
and they could also catch fish to eat
after several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them in september food was running short so they till animals and drank fresh water from springs
they found here and there
they found coconuts while hunting for animals
they took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside
they caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the ground and sticks laid across with grass on top of them
at night they slept all together under coconut trees
they were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning
one morning in december a ship was going across the sea to england they waved and waved again
then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted
as soon as they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the captain's office
they all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in june and we have been there since
they arrived in england 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in england again

i want to get married in white
i want to go abroad for my honeymoon
for the first summer holiday i would like to go to butlin's holiday camp
for my children i would like a blue and white or black pram
stephen asked me if i would like to go so he bought two tickets for him and me and we went in and pauline and trevor were sitting in there holding hands
so we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out and it was very dark in there then stephen was sitting there next to me and pauline said go on stephen hold judith's hand and after a while he did and he didn't let go of it until the film was over
the best boyfriend i ever had
she's father was posted
and so stephen left
but we still send letters and postcards to each other
so that we still remember each other
one fine morning i got up and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee but at my disaster i found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep so i grabbed it quick and brought it in it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes well of course i would have loved to keep the child but i knew that wouldn't be right so i telephoned the police and told them everything that had happened and told me to take the baby down to the police station
so i got ready and set off to the station
of course i liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the police
they said that they would put up notices about the baby
they let me look after him until someone owned up
a month later
a month went but nobody owned up and the police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said i could adopt the baby if i wanted to if not they would put it in a home
i soon got married and talked it over with my husband and he said it was ok with him so in a few days time the baby was ours and were'nt we pleased
so we all lived happily ever after

in the summer holidays
one day about the second week i was going shopping and taking my friend for a walk
when three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags for me of course i went as red as beetroot but when i came back they called me again so after a while i went and picked it up i started talking to them every day
betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner they got 2 lb of potatoes 1 large tin beans and 1/2lb ham and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6 10d when they got home the girls cooked the meal
they started out and the sea got deeper but it was lovely the sun was shining like a star glittering at night the sea was calm and bright as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea it was just like a dream which has come true
because it's night time and dark
because the wind is wild
because the two waves are a ring
it's where the sea has washed away the side of the rocks
the front of the boat where the sea ran up the beach
because there are trees in way there whispering to each other the sun is hot with wild animals roaming around
the beach is so hot and the sea is calm animals are roaming here and there

they ran away to get married in a little country called lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother father maids and four children the eldest was jenny who was 18 years of age she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12 jenny had a boyfriend who lived a few yards away from her his name was johnny he was 20 years of age
jenny and johnny wanted to get marreid they had known each other for 6 years and were very much in love
they had got mostly everything to start with they had a double bed curtains dressing table crockery and lots of other things to start a married home
but the only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent to the marriage
so the two young children decided to run away and get married
so they packed a few clothes and johnny got two tickets on a train to london they had some money in the bank about 30
so one bright sunny morning they got up about six o'clock and made their way to the station
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast
soon they were on the train
now we needn't worry about anything my darling said johnny
no we can get a job in london and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own said jenny
yes then we can go back home tell our parents the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to london
2 months pass they got a flat and were now thinking of getting married so they got married in a registry office and after they celebrated until 12 o'clock that night then a week later they got tickets back to lawton they got home and went and rang on jenny's doorbell first
her father came to the door and took one look and slammed the door in their faces and shouted out i don't know where you've been but i don't want you to lay a step inside this house you're an absolute disgrace to our family but dad shouted jenny i've only come home to tell you the news what's that he said i am married that's why i and johnny ran away we got married in a registry office
so said her father oh well i wish you the best of luck in your marriage but i do wish you'd told us all because i think you are old enough to be man and wife well my daughter and son in law welcome home
you can live here both of you until you get a decent place of your own thank you dad and thank you sir said johnny don't call me sir my son you're one of us now so you may as well call me dad i must go and fetch your parents johnny and we will celebrate said her father all the family got together and celebrated
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl and they all lived happily ever after

i hope you are o.k
just a few lines to write about our english lesson with mr holbrook in the last 12 months
he has taught us how to write good letters stories and poems
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years
but some work hasn't taught us a single thing we have to learn a fair bit of english to help us as we get older and out to work

sir
mr t says mr holbrook is too soft with us by not teaching us spellings
i agree with mr t because you cannot write a good story without knowing how to spell i am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words differcult but people who get under 40 find words very differcult
if you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school
i think mr holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so i think it is essential that we should write properly
i have written a lot of stories in the term i have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so i find it quite easy
william glebe
sir
mr t says that mr holbrook our english teacher is too soft and does'nt teach us very good english but i don't believe one word of it it is absolutely nonsense he is a good enough teacher for any child to learn from
we write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them
mr t said it will be be harder for us when we leave school but if we consantrate and listen to what we are told in english we will have no trouble when we go out into the world
when we write stories i think the story is much more important than the spellings and punctuation
yours faithfully judith
when we have mr holbrook we have to write a story and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea our sinking of
jack o'malley
we have to work hard and it tacks hard work to write those storm and it very hard when people say he soft on us
joan stall
i think mr t should come and see mr
holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a frame magazine
