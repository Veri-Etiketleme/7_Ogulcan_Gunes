## SPICED Academy /// Week 03 /// Linear Regression<br><br>
Within the third week of SPICED Academy, I conducted a machine learning model on the "bike sharing" dataset. 
After an extensive exploratory data analysis, outliers, highly-correlated features und potential data leakage were removed from the original data set. 

Afterwards, a machine learning model using linear regression was conducted, making use of feature engineering (OneHotEncoder, MinMax, Polynominal Transformation) to improve the model`s scoring. In order to ensure the models robustness regarding unseen data sets, cross-validation (stratified knn-folds) and various metrics were conducted. 

Additionally, various machine learning models were applied and their performance ranking was compared, just for the purpose of fun.
