# EVOVAE: Variational Auto-encoding of protein sequences

Protein function prediction using a variational autoencoder. You can find the short [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03346.pdf) which was an oral presentation at [NIPS MLCB workshop 2017](https://mlcb.github.io/).

This repository contains the [detailed workflow](https://github.com/samsinai/VAE_protein_function/blob/master/VAE_for_protein_function_prediction.ipynb), and is associated with this [blog post](https://samsinai.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/08/14/Using-a-Variational-Autoencoder-to-predict-protein-function.html). 

You can find more alignments/validation data to analyze [from Marks' lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/evmutation/downloads.html). Also, their group has done a [comprehensive analysis on the application of VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06527) for all of this data independently.
