# Currency-Prediction-with-RNN
Cryptocurrency prediction using recurrent neural network

Although the first redistributed cryptocurrency (bitcoin) was created in 2009, the idea of digital money arised in 1980s. In the recent years, cryptocurrencies have gained tremendeous popularity. As traditional currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies are changing in time. Using the historical data, I will implement a recurrent neural netwok using LSTM (Long short-term memory) layers to predict the trend of value of a cryptocurrency in the future.

There is a huge dataset about cryptocurrency market prices on Kaggle. I only used a part of it which is historical price data of litecoin.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) and powerful to model sequence data because it maintains an internal state to keep track of the data it has already seen. Common applications of LSTMs include time series analysis and natural language processing.
